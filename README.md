## Install

Once you created or cloned this repository, make sure the installation is running properly. Install the package dependencies with the provided script `setup_env.sh`.
Check available options with
```bash
tools/setup_env.sh -h
```
We distinguish pinned installations based on exported (reproducible) environments and free installations where the installation
is based on top-level dependencies listed in `requirements/requirements.yaml`. If you start developing, you might want to do an unpinned installation and export the environment:

```bash
tools/setup_env.sh -u -e -n <package_env_name>
```
*Hint*: If you are the package administrator, it is a good idea to understand what this script does, you can do everything manually with `conda` instructions.

*Hint*: Use the flag `-m` to speed up the installation using mamba. Of course you will have to install mamba first we recommend to install mamba into your base
environment `conda install -c conda-forge mamba`. If you install mamba in another (maybe dedicated) environment, environments installed with mamba will be located
in `<miniconda_root_dir>/envs/mamba/envs`, which is not very practical.

The package itself is installed with `pip`. For development, install in editable mode:

```bash
conda activate <package_env_name>
pip install --editable .
```

*Warning:* Make sure you use the right pip, i.e. the one from the installed conda environment (`which pip` should point to something like `path/to/miniconda/envs/<package_env_name>/bin/pip`).

Once your package is installed, run the tests by typing:

```
conda activate <package_env_name>
pytest
```
