**Meteodata-lab** is a NumPy/Xarray-based Python library for processing and analyzing gridded meteorological data. It supports GRIB (read/write) and is tailored to common workflows that require data interpolation, regridding to custom grids (e.g., Swiss grid or rotated lat/lon), and the computation of advanced meteorological fields. One of the key features of meteodata-lab is its use of operators that ensure the integrity of GRIB metadata is maintained throughout processing, allowing for consistent writing back to GRIB format.

## Installation


### For Users

To install the latest release from PyPI:

```bash
pip install meteodata-lab
```
#### Optional Extras
To install optional extras:
```bash
pip install "meteodata-lab[polytope,regrid]"
```
**Note**: The `fdb` extra is currently disabled because its dependency `pyfdb` is not available on PyPI. As an alternative the development setup can be used.

### For Development
To set up the project for local development, clone the repository and use the provided Poetry setup script:
```bash
git clone git@github.com:MeteoSwiss/meteodata-lab.git
cd meteodata-lab
./scripts/setup_poetry.sh
```
This will install Poetry (if not already available), set up the virtual environment, and install all dependencies with extras.
